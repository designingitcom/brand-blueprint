# Comprehensive Code Audit

## Declutter Focus Areas
- Find and remove all unused files and components
- Identify duplicate folders and consolidate
- Remove unused npm dependencies
- Clean up unused imports in all files
- Find and remove dead code
- Identify commented-out code blocks for removal
- Find orphaned test files
- Remove old build artifacts and temp files
- Clean up unused CSS/SCSS rules
- Identify unused images and assets
- Find empty or nearly empty files
- Consolidate similar utility functions

## Analysis Required
- Generate dependency graph to find unused packages
- Create file usage map
- Identify circular dependencies
- Find files not imported anywhere
- Check for duplicate function implementations
- Analyze bundle size and suggest optimizations

## Output
- Detailed report of all findings
- List of files safe to delete
- Recommendations for consolidation
- Before/after metrics (file count, bundle size, etc.)
