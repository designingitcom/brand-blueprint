Logic: Only appears for subjective questions (starting question 4+)
Exclusions: Factual questions (name, website, industry, LinkedIn, selections, results)

Scoring Logic:

```typescript
// Confidence levels
1-2: "Guessing or very uncertain" (Low/Red)
3: "Somewhat confident, could use more research" (Medium/Amber)
4-5: "Very confident, well-researched answer" (High/Green)
N/A: "Question doesn't apply to my situation" (Gray)
```

Validation:
Required: Next button disabled until confidence provided for applicable questions
Calculations: Overall confidence excludes N/A responses
Display: Tooltips explain purpose and scoring meanings

üìñ Question Guidance System

Tabbed Interface:
Tips Tab (üí°): Strategic advice and best practices
Examples Tab (‚úì): Real-world examples in quotes
ELI5 Tab (üß∏): Simple explanations for complex concepts

Interactive Behavior:
Toggle Logic: Same tab click hides content, different tab shows new content

Content Structure: Bullet points with icons, easy scanning

Implementation Pattern:

```tsx
<QuestionGuidance
  questionNumber={4}
  tips={['Strategic advice...', 'Best practices...']}
  examples={['Real example 1', 'Real example 2']}
  simpleExplanation={['Simple explanation 1', 'Simple explanation 2']}
/>
```

üí° Smart Logic & Algorithms

Confidence Score Processing:

```typescript
// Only show for applicable questions
const isConfidenceApplicable = (questionIndex: number) => {
  const factualQuestions = [0, 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 45]; // exclusion list
  return !factualQuestions.includes(questionIndex);
};

// Calculate overall confidence
const getOverallConfidence = () => {
  const scores = Object.values(confidenceScores).filter(score => score > 0);
  return (
    Math.round(
      (scores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0) / scores.length) * 10
    ) / 10
  );
};
```

Content Generation Logic:
Positioning Statement: Template with user data insertion
Hero Content: Dynamic headline/subheading generation
Messaging Framework: Context-aware content suggestions
