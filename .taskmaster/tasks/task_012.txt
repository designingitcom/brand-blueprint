# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop AI-Powered Question Assistance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the question answering process with AI-powered suggestions based on user inputs.
# Details:
Implement AI suggestions for each question type, ensuring context awareness and multiple suggestion options.

# Test Strategy:
Test AI suggestions for various questions to ensure they are contextually relevant and helpful.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Question Types and Contexts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and document the different question types that will be enhanced with AI suggestions, along with the contexts in which they will be used.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive list of question types (e.g., multiple choice, open-ended, rating scales) and define the context for each type. This will serve as the foundation for implementing AI suggestions.

## 2. Develop AI Suggestion Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create the algorithm that will generate AI-powered suggestions based on user inputs and the defined question types.
### Details:
Implement a machine learning model or rule-based system that takes user input and context to generate relevant suggestions. Ensure the model is trained on a diverse dataset to improve accuracy.

### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Modify the user interface to display AI-generated suggestions alongside the question input fields.
### Details:
Update the front-end code to fetch and display suggestions from the AI algorithm in real-time as users type their questions. Ensure the UI is intuitive and user-friendly.

## 4. Implement Context Awareness Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Enhance the AI suggestions to be context-aware by incorporating user history and preferences.
### Details:
Develop logic to analyze user history and preferences to tailor suggestions more effectively. This may involve storing user data and creating algorithms to interpret it.

## 5. Conduct Comprehensive Testing and Refinement [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Perform extensive testing of the entire AI-powered question assistance feature to ensure functionality and user satisfaction.
### Details:
Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including different question types and user inputs. Gather user feedback and refine the AI suggestions based on testing results.
