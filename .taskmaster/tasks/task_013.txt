# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Module Dependencies and Progression Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create logic to manage module dependencies and user progression through the strategy path.
# Details:
Develop algorithms to unlock modules based on prerequisite completion and visualize user progress across modules.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that modules unlock correctly based on user progress.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Module Structure and Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a data structure to represent modules and their dependencies. This should include attributes for each module such as ID, title, description, and a list of prerequisite module IDs.
### Details:
Use a JSON format to define the module structure. Each module should have a unique ID and a list of prerequisite IDs that must be completed before unlocking the module.

## 2. Implement Module Unlock Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the algorithm that checks if a user has completed the prerequisite modules and unlocks the next module accordingly.
### Details:
Create a function that takes a userâ€™s completed modules as input and compares it against the defined module dependencies. If all prerequisites are met, the module should be marked as unlocked.

## 3. Track User Progress Across Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a system to track user progress through the modules, storing which modules have been completed and which are currently unlocked.
### Details:
Use a database or local storage to save user progress. Create functions to update the progress when a module is completed and retrieve the current status of unlocked modules.

## 4. Visualize User Progress [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user interface component that visually represents the user's progress through the modules, highlighting completed and unlocked modules.
### Details:
Design a UI component that displays modules in a flowchart or list format. Use colors or icons to indicate completed, unlocked, and locked modules.

## 5. Integrate Progression Logic with User Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure that the module progression logic is integrated with the user authentication system, allowing progress to be saved and retrieved based on user sessions.
### Details:
Link the module progression data to the user authentication system so that each user's progress is tied to their account. Ensure that progress is loaded upon user login.
