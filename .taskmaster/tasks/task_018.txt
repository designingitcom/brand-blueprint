# Task ID: 18
# Title: Conduct Performance Testing and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform performance testing to ensure the application meets uptime and response time requirements.
# Details:
Conduct load testing and optimize database queries to ensure the application meets performance metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Monitor performance metrics during testing to ensure they meet defined criteria.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Performance Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and document the specific performance metrics that the application needs to meet, including uptime and response time requirements.
### Details:
Gather input from stakeholders to define acceptable performance metrics. Document these metrics in a shared document for reference during testing.

## 2. Set Up Load Testing Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Prepare the environment for conducting load testing, including selecting appropriate tools and configuring the application for testing.
### Details:
Choose a load testing tool (e.g., JMeter, Gatling) and set it up. Ensure the application is deployed in a test environment that mirrors production settings.

## 3. Conduct Load Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Execute load tests based on the defined performance metrics to evaluate the application's response times and uptime under various load conditions.
### Details:
Use the load testing tool to simulate user traffic and monitor the application's performance. Collect data on response times and uptime during the tests.

## 4. Optimize Database Queries [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.3
### Description: Review and optimize database queries to improve application performance based on the findings from the load testing.
### Details:
Identify slow-performing queries from the load test results and optimize them by adding indexes, rewriting queries, or adjusting database configurations.

## 5. Document Performance Testing Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.4
### Description: Compile and document the results of the performance testing and optimization efforts, including metrics achieved and any recommendations for future improvements.
### Details:
Create a report summarizing the performance metrics, load testing results, and any optimizations made. Share this report with stakeholders for review.
